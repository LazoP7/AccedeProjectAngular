# AccedeProject

Accede was created as a web application for my Logate Academy final project.
It uses everything I have learned over my course and expands upon it.

## What is Accede

Accede means to agree upon. It is an application that it meant to solve a problem I have faced living in Podgorica. Many of my friends and people in Montenegro play sports as a hobby, 
and it can be difficult to find people needed for a match.
That is where Accede comes in. It is a web application designed to match you with other people who are in need of a teammate.

## Accede Angular

Front-end for Accede was done using Angular, thought my course we focused more on back-end so my css is very basic.
